                    <p>
                        I have always been hands-on and believe strongly that the best leaders (especially in software) 
                        should be able to dive deep and understand the work that their teams are doing. This 
                        website is a way for me to share my skills, learn new things, and share my journey. Eventually, I will start to showcase some of my other talents with some Open Source code and 
                        projects, and I hope to build a collaborative space for developers. Please feel free to send me feedback, 
                        comments, or berate me for my poor web development skills! I am not much
                        of a web developer (or designer), but I'm looking forward to learning and taking you on this journey 
                        with me.

                <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        My name is John Bernard and I am a software leader with over a decade of experience leading
                        teams and organizations to success. My journey to get here has been a backwards one, starting
                        out in the Army teaching Soldiers hand-to-hand combat, leading Intelligence teams, and mentoring
                        junior Leaders. During this time, I got to work with some amazing software teams that developed
                        our Intelligence systems and instilled a passion for Agile software development and innovation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon leaving the Army, I worked in a number of industries leading teams and organizations to
                        success, from Real Estate to Construction to building Networks for COCOMs. I often found myself
                        leading Agile change in organizations that were typically waterfall and re-working processes to
                        be more innovative and efficient, including in the initial bidding and contracting phases of projects.
                        In the last five years, I have been diving fully into the software world, building full stack
                        applications, platforms, and solutions for the DoD. It has been a huge learning curve, but I have 
                        enjoyed every minute of it. Most recently, I'm learning all about Observability, SRE, and advanced
                        Kubernetes and Cloud solutions.

                <h3>Where might you work with me?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I prefer a challenging role (which might explain my diverse experience and roles) in organizations 
                        that value innovation, invest in their people, and aren't afraid of change. I prefer to make an impact, 
                        whether that's overseeing operations, strategic planning and generating business, or getting involved 
                        in the nitty gritty of software development. If you're looking to hire me; 
                        I'm open to roles in executive positions, such as a 
                        director, VP, Architect, or CTO, but am open to other challenges as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also enjoy short-term wins and you can always pitch something that you need some temporary help with 
                        and I'd be happy to help as a consultant or contractor! I look forward to working with you!
