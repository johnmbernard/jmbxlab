        <h2>About JMBXLab</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my personal site! I'm building this site to be an advertisement for me and showcase my work
            and in the future, be a collaborative space for developers and engineers to share news and ideas.
            I'm looking forward to working with you all and hopefully this site will be a great resource for
            new developers and engineers like me!
        </p>
        <p>
            I have always been hands on and believe strongly that the best leaders (especially in software) 
            should be able to get dive deep and understand the work that their teams are doing. This 
            website is a way for me to share my skills, learn new things, and share my journey. Please follow
            along as I build the front end of this application, connect it to a backend complete with a database
            and authentication, and build a Kubernetes cluster to host it. Eventually, I will be adding a "feed"
            where we can all post and share news, ideas, and thoughts, and I'm sure I will need to upgrade my 
            tech stack to include React, Tailwindcss, etc. Please enjoy the journey and feel free
            to reach out, especially to tell me I'm wrong or inefficient!
        </p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is John Bernard and I am a software leader with over a decade of experience leading
            teams and organizations to success. My journey to get here has been a backwards one, starting
            out in the Army teaching Soldiers hand to hand combat, leading Intelligence teams, and mentoring
            junior Leaders. During this time, I got to work with some amazing software teams that developed
            our Intelligence systems and instilled a passion for Agile software development and innovation.
        
        <p>
            Upon leaving the Army, I worked in a number of industries leading teams and organizations to
            success, from Real Estate to Construction to building Networks for COCOMs. I often found myself
            leading Agile change in organizations that were typically waterfall and re-working processes to
            be more innovative and efficient, including in the initial bidding and contracting phases of projects.
            In the last five years, I have been diving fully into the software world, building full stack
            applications, platforms, and solutions for the DoD. It has been a huge learning curve, but I have 
            enjoyed every minute of it. Most recently, I'm learning all about Observability, SRE, and advanced
            Kubernetes and Cloud solutions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I prefer a challenging role (which might explain my diverse experience and roles) in organizations 
            that value innovation, invest in their people, and aren't afraid of change. In the last 10 years 
            I have been an effective senior leader, executing the vision of executives in the organization.
            For my next role, I'm looking to transition to an executive role as a director, architect, and VP.
            I've consistently and successfully led projects through their full lifecycles from initiation to close
            and have been extremely successful at business strategy, growing projects and portfolios and ensuring
            the organizations I've worked for continue to grow wherever I can. I'm ready to have a higher impact
            in an organization and lead senior managers like myself.
